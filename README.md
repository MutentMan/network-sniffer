A network sniffer (also known as a packet sniffer or network analyzer) is a tool used to capture, inspect, and analyze network traffic flowing over a computer network. It can be a software program or hardware device.

üîç Description of a Network Sniffer:
Function:
It intercepts and logs data packets traveling across the network. This includes both incoming and outgoing packets.

Usage:
Network troubleshooting
Monitoring network usage
Detecting malicious activity
Penetration testing
Protocol analysis

How it works:
A network interface card (NIC) normally discards all traffic not addressed to it. A sniffer puts the NIC into promiscuous mode, so it captures all packets on the local network segment.

üõ°Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations:
Authorized Use Only: Sniffing without permission is illegal and unethical.
Used legally by network admins, security researchers, and ethical hackers for diagnostics and auditing
